# Feetwings
An Arduino Nano based smart sole (prototype) capable of counting the steps, heart rate, gesture detection. The sole indicates if the person has accidentally fallen(twisted or fallen both)and has an emergency alarm which can be called out after putting the feet in a particular orientation and can be set by the user. The details are also displayed on a LCD (16x2) screen. The stats are also shown on a Bluetooth connected app on the android phone.
